# Anatomy In VR

 a project where we expose students to a VR session where 
they can directly inspect 3D models of several human organs by using Virtual Reality systems. 
Our systems allow the students to see the models directly visualized in 3D and to interact with 
them as if they were real. By using Virtual Reality the student is able to inspect and interact 
directly with the anatomical structure. 






## Tools Required for this project 

 - Unity 3D 2019.3.8f1
 - Visual Studio
 - Google VR
 - Blender 3D
 - Sketch up Pro 

  

  
## Screenshots

  As we successfully executed our VR app. The graphics of the environment and the organs are
smoother. Hence, the scene implementation is successful. For user to interact with this 
environment we used a movement script which allows user to move around the lab using a 
controller.

We used hide and show script to manipulate buttons and to change organs in cube room. 
Pressing the name will play an audio about organ features.

Each organ has its functionality table where user can know details about it.
